        The theme of jealousy place a major role in both plays.
        In the Winter’s Tale King Leontes suspects his wife, Queen Hermione, and his childhood friend, Kind Polixens, is having an affair.
        The Queen is pregnant at the time so he assumes the baby is not his and orders it to be murdered after delivery.
        There are significant difference in the two plays.
        Othello is tragedy and therefore ends in a sad manner. 
        Othello kills Desdemona out of jealousy and rage but finds out after she is dead that she was one hundred percent faithful to him. 
        The Winter’s Tale is a tragicomedy and therefore has an happy ending. 
        King Leontes discovers he has falsely accused his wife after she and their son, Maumillius, pass away.
      </h5>
      
        Othello is convinced by his evil friend, Iago, that is wife, Desdemona, is having an affair with Othello’s best friend, Cassio. 
        Iago’s wicked behavior is motivated by the fact that he thinks Othello has slept with his wife and because Othello did not make Iago his first lieutenant in his army. 
        The main characters jealousy is what drives the play along and ultimately leads to their suffering. 
        Adultery also connects these two plays. In the plays time period adultery is seen as a crime that is punishable by death. 
        Iago tries to punish Othello for assuming he has slept with his wife but does not try to openly punish his wife. 
        He has no real proof and does not want anyone to know of this act  because it would cause him great embarrassment. 
        Iago keeps his mouth shut and does not tell anyone but in acts his revenge quietly.
        The baby, Perdita, is not murdered but left in the woods and rescued by a Shepard. 
        She grows into a beautiful young woman and by chance finds her way back to her father, the King. 
        Leontes is more then happy to know his daughter is alive. Once they are reunited, the Queen magically comes back to life. 
        This happy ending seems to have a mythical spin on it. When the Queen dies the only witness is her friend and lady in waiting, Paulina.
